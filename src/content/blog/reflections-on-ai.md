# Reflections on AI (LLMs) in Development

## Data Processing and Documentation
LLMs are great at crunching data and outputting it in formats as desired. I've had more success with AI parsing large sets of code and outputting quality documentation than with clean code generation. They are able to quickly pick up external dependencies and internal code paths, allowing them to infer what the product is doing (with some intervention).

## Prototyping with AI
LLMs excel at producing proofs of concept (POCs). Over the last few months, I’ve had some ideas about what I wanted to accomplish in our codebase without having the time to do so. AI was able to perform these tasks as an agent at a level I may expect from a Junior to Mid-level engineer. Obviously, some spoon-feeding is required, and the results may vary; but for the most part, it's allowed me to focus on tasks that require more concentration.

## Quality of Code Output
Despite its confidence, the code produced by AI is often mediocre. AI can generate anything you ask for with complete confidence, but the quality is not always what I expect. Following up with more context and prompts doesn’t always lead to the desired outcome, which means I spend more time studying best practices and documentation for the build. I miss the growing community at Stack Overflow, but I hope continual AI output encourages more engineers to engage with these communities and continue to grow.

## Managing My Development Workflow
I manage my development workflow by using the Arc browser, which allows me to organize my tabs into three buckets: 

1. **Agents in Progress**
2. **PRs Ready for Review**
3. **PRs That Require Intervention**

With this structure, I'm able to quickly jump around and manage my agents while also using my time to make modifications to the PRs produced to ensure no AI-generated slop falls through.

P.S. I wrote this article without AI, but I formatted it with AI. I'm still using my brain. Cool huh?
